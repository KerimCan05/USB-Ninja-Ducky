# USB Ninja Ducky
USB Ninja Ducky is a project for those who are interested and curious about USB Rubber Ducky to develop their own USB Ninja Ducky at home.
It is a project to pretend that a non-HID USB memory is HID and run certain keyboard combinations.

# User Manual:

There are many payloads developed for this project. 
They are written with visual basic script.
You can copy them to your USB memory and make them run as soon as the USB memory is inserted with "USB AutoRun Creator".
If you want a video explanation, practical videos for USB Ninja Ducky will be coming soon.
